    "Q1. Min-Max Scaling and its Application in Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is a technique used to scale numerical features in a specific range, usually between 0 and 1. It's calculated by the formula:\n",

    "Xscaled= X-min(X)/max(X)-min(X)\n",

    "X is the original value, \n",
    "min(X) and max(X) represent the minimum and maximum values in the dataset, respectively. This transformation helps in bringing all features to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset with values ranging from 10 to 50. By applying Min-Max scaling, you'd transform these values to lie between 0 and 1, preserving the proportion of the data within the original range."

    "Q2. Unit Vector Technique in Feature Scaling and Difference from Min-Max Scaling:\n",
    "The unit vector technique (also known as normalization) rescales each sample to have a length of 1. It adjusts the values within a vector to a unit length, irrespective of the original magnitude. This method is particularly useful when the magnitude of each feature is not significant, and direction matters more than the magnitude.\n",

    "Q3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "PCA is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the information. It does so by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated features known as principal components. These components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say you have a dataset with numerous features. By applying PCA, you can identify the most critical aspects that describe the variance in the data. For instance, from 10 features, you might find that the first three principal components explain 95% of the variance, enabling a representation of the data in a reduced dimension.\n"

    "PCA is a technique used for feature extraction by transforming the original features into a smaller set of uncorrelated features. This process helps in retaining most of the information present in the original dataset. The extracted features, i.e., the principal components, are linear combinations of the original features.\n",

    "In a food delivery recommendation system, by applying Min-Max scaling to features like price, rating, and delivery time, you'll bring these features to a common scale (e.g., between 0 and 1) so that no single feature dominates the others due to its scale differences. This allows fair comparisons and analyses across the different features.\n"
